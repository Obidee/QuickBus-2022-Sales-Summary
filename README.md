# QuickBus-2022-Sales-Summary
An explanation of QuickBus Nigeria's 2022 business performance with respect to Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and ticket volume.

As the lead of the operations of QuickBus Nigeria, I had the responsibility to report on the Nigerian business to the rest of the team, the teams in other markets and the C-suite.
Before I go further, let me give a summary of what QuickBus is and the work that we do.
QuickBus is an inter-city long distance bus travel aggregator, connecting travellers and bus operators digitally. Actually, I wrote a Medium article of our one year anniversary in Nigeria, you can read [here](https://medium.com/@obi.nnebe/one-year-of-quickbus-nigeria-dc8ca2c8ef62 "One Year of QuickBus Nigeria")

**Steps Taken:**

In the analysis of the company's data, the following steps were taken;

1. I exported the records of all ticket transactions as CSV file.

2. The CSV file was imported into Microsoft Excel where all the analysis were carried out.

3. Data cleaning: I noticed some wrong formatting and some missing data in the file. I had to request for support from the tech team and customer support team in order to verify the data and help provide missing data.

4. After the cleaning process, I broke all transactions into years 2021, 2022 (full year) and 2023. Since we launched in November 2021, and this report happened in January 2023, 2022 was the only full year of operation and available data.

5. I created pivot tables to summarize the dataset with focus to each business question being answered.
6. After creating the pivot tables, I plotted charts in a different sheet to answer each question.

The results of the analysis and recommendations have been attached in this repo as pdf.
It is also worthy to note that permission was obtained from management of the company to display this analysis and the information publicly on my pertfolio.
